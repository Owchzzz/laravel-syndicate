# Laravel Syndicate
Laravel syndicate is a package that will add in the ability to create teams and organizations within your Laravel Application.

- Minimum Supported Laravel Version: 7.0

Publish the necessary configuration files for laravel syndicate:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=syndicate
```

If you use Laravel Lighthouse we have prepared graphql packages for you to install:
```
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=syndicate-lighthouse
```

   This Library is stand alone and you will be able to use it without the need for GraphQL/Laravel Lighthouse, but this package is built to have the support out of the box, to use with laravel lighthouse.
